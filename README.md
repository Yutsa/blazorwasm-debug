# How to debug Blazor WebAssembly Hosted

There are two VS Code launch configurations.

Start by launching `Launch and Debug Standalone Blazor WebAssembly App` to run the app and the debug for
the client code.

Then launch `Debug Server` to debug the server code. You can run both at the same time and have the debugger working on VS Code.
